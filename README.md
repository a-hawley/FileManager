# FileManager
A GUI based file manager

This file manager relies on the Tkinter, Shutil, EasyGUI, and OS libraries.
It contains the ability to copy, move, rename, delete files, as well as create and list directories.

The purpose of this project was to explore the capabilities and accessibility of the Tkinter library. I look forward to using Tkinter more in the future.
